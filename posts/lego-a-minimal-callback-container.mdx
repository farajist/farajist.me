## Introduction

Dependency injection is a concept that has been at the core of many software components since its inception, it permits
the inversion of control .....

## Why not just use `require()` or `import`

## Why lego ?

Imagine having a system that needs to fetch data from different sources and store it to a database, in a scenario which the data sources 
are known and limited we can implement the fetching logic in place in form of functions for example, [that can be called when required]

However, it is often the case that such systems require extension either by adding new data sources or updating the fetching logic of existing ones,
with more components in place, maintenance can get tricky and modularization kicks in, this is the problem `lego` addresses.

## Creating a plugin with `lego`

### The plugin manifest

### The container

## Roadmap and further discussion
