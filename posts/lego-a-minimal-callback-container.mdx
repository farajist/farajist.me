## Introduction

Dependency injection is a concept that has been at the core of many software components since its inception, it permits
the inversion of control .....

## Why not just use `require()` or `import`

While CommonJS's `require` and ES6's `import` are the Nodejs's way of supporting modules, these come short at several features such as: 

#### Discoverability

Without explicitly requiring or importing a module, the runtime has no way of using a module, whereas 
by setting the right container configuration and plugin manifest, `lego` is able to auto-discover and load plugins.

#### Hot loading

In Nodejs modules cannot be resolved at runtime, which limit the extensibility of the program.

#### Requirement validation

Node's module system offers no way to validate what has been imported and result can be surprising at runtime, `lego` container 
ensures that the resolved package conforms to the expected function type.

## Why lego ?

Imagine having a system that needs to fetch data from different sources and store it to a database, in a scenario which the data sources 
are known and limited we can implement the fetching logic in place in the form of functions for example, [that can be called when required]

However, it is often the case that such systems require extension either by adding new data sources or updating the fetching logic of existing ones,
with more components in place, maintenance can get tricky and the need for a modular design kicks in, this is the problem `lego` addresses.

## Creating a plugin with `lego`

The idea behind `lego` is as simple as having a uniform 

### The plugin manifest

The manifest is a plugin descriptor, it is basically a simple YAML file with two necessary pieces of information: the plugin identifier (name) and 
the entry point (main.js), the current version of lego only support entry points that export a function:

```yaml
version: '0.0.0' # optional
name: 'hello' # should be unique
main: 'main.js'
```

### The container

The container is the interface used to give access to loaded plugin, a container instance is created only once at the top level of the app, the returned
object yields a resolve function that can be called with the plugin id to obtain a the defaultly exported function of the plugin:

```typescript
  const { resolve } = createContainer({ paths: ['node_modules', 'my_plugins'] });
  // resolve performs simple callback lookup using plugin name
  const sayHello = resolve('hello');
  // sayHello now can be called like a normal function
  console.log(sayHello());
```
